A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.\n<P>\n1) <B>TCP/IP Fingerprint</B>: The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this "fingerprinting" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. \n<P>\nNote that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.\n<P>\n2) <B>NetBIOS</B>: Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). \n<P>\n3) <B>PHP Info</B>: PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.\n<P>\n4) <B>SNMP</B>: The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach.

A successful exploit manipulates query criteria in a manner that affects the query\'s logic. The typical causes of this vulnerability are lack of input validation and insecure construction of the SQL query.\n</P>\n<P>Queries created by concatenating strings with SQL syntax and user-supplied data are prone to this vulnerability. When any part of the string concatenation can be modified, an attacker has the ability to change the meaning of the query.\n</P>\n<P>Typical detection techniques for SQL injection vulnerabilities use a payload that attempts to produce an error response from the web application. Detection based on blind SQL injection uses inference based on the differences among the application\'s responses to various payloads. Blind SQL does not rely on error messages, which is beneficial when testing web applications that trap errors.\n</P>\n<P><B>How It Works:</B><BR>\nThe WAS scanning engine uses a well known methodology called <I>"True and False"</I> inference to determine if there is a blind SQL injection vulnerability. Basically, it uses two payloads: one with a \n<I>"True condition"</I> and another with a <I>"False condition"</I>. If there is a blind SQL injection vulnerability, the query with the \n"True condition" payload will cause the web application to return a different response than the \n"False condition". \n</P>\nA good example of a "True condition" payload would be <B>\' AND 1=1</B>. Since 1 always equals 1, the condition is true. An example of a "False condition" payload would be <B>\' AND 1=2</B>. Since 1 does not equal 2, the condition is false.\n<P>\nFor example, let\'s say there is a web application with a textbox that searches for customer names and displays the results inside a table. And let\'s assume that if someone searches for John there is one result only. When scanning for the blind SQL injection vulnerability, the WAS scanning engine uses two payloads:</P>\n- <U>True condition payload</U>: This injects the string <B>John\' AND 1=1</B> to issue the query\n\t<I>"return John only if 1=1"</I>. Since 1 always equals 1 the condition is true. The result is John, which is the same result as using the string John.\n<P>\n- <U>False condition payload</U>: This injects the string <B>John\' AND 1=2</B> to issue the query\n\t<I>"return John only if 1=2"</I>. Since 1 is never equal to 2, the condition is false. The result is nothing or "No results found".\n<P>\nWith the results from the two payloads, the WAS scanning engine draws the conclusion that there is a blind SQL injection vulnerability. Even though there is no one called \n<I>"John\' AND 1=1"</I> in the database, web application displays information for "John" if a search is done with that query string.</P>\n<P>\n<B>Example:</B><BR>\nThese few lines demonstrate an insecure query that is created by appending user-supplied data (<B>name</B>):\n</P>\n<CODE>\nOn Error Resume Next \' Page traps error and do not display it<BR>\nSet oRSu = oCONv.Execute("SELECT fname, name FROM customers WHERE name = \'" &amp; Request("txtSearch") &amp; "\'")<BR>\nIf oRSu.BOF Or Err.Number <> 0 Then<BR>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Response.Write "No results found!"<BR>\nEnd If\n</CODE>\n<P>\nIf no checks are performed against the name parameter, then the query may be arbitrarily modified and sent to database as shown in these two examples of a completed query:\n</P>\n<CODE>\nSELECT fname, name FROM customers WHERE name=\'<B>John\' AND 1=1</B> <BR>\nSELECT fname, name FROM customers WHERE name= \'John\'; SHUTDOWN WITH NOWAIT\n</CODE>\n<P>In the first case the database will return <I>"John"</I> since the condition <B>AND 1=1</B> is always true.', 'The scope of a SQL injection exploit varies greatly. If any SQL statement can be injected into the query, then the attacker has the equivalent access of a database administrator. This access could lead to theft of data, malicious corruption of data, or deletion of data.', 'SQL injection vulnerabilities can be addressed in three areas: input validation, query creation, and database security.\n<P>\nAll input received from the web client should be validated for correct content. If a value\'s type or content range is known beforehand, then stricter filters should be applied. For example, an email address should be in a specific format and only contain characters that make it a valid address; or numeric fields like a USA zip code should be limited to five digit values.\n<P>\nPrepared statements (sometimes referred to as parameterized statements) provide strong protection from SQL injection. Prepared statements are precompiled SQL queries whose parameters can be modified when the query is executed. Prepared statements enforce the logic of the query and will fail if the query cannot be compiled correctly. Programming languages that support prepared statements provide specific functions for creating queries. These functions are more secure than string concatenation for assigning user-supplied data to a query.\n<P>\nStored procedures are precompiled queries that reside in the database. Like prepared statements, they also enforce separation of query data and logic. SQL statements that call stored procedures should not be created via string concatenation, otherwise their security benefits are negated.\n<P>\nSQL injection exploits can be mitigated by the use of Access Control Lists or role-based access within the database. For example, a read-only account would prevent an attacker from modifying data, but would not prevent the user from viewing unauthorized data. Table and row-based access controls potentially minimize the scope of a compromise, but they do not prevent exploits.\n<P>\nExample of a secure query created with a prepared statement:\n<BR>\n<CODE>\nPreparedStatement ps = "SELECT name,email FROM users WHERE userid=?";\nps.setInt(1, userid);\n</CODE>'], ['QID', '150013', 'Browser-Specific Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities', 'Confirmed Vulnerability', '5', 'XSS', 'A7', 'WASC-8', 'CWE-79', '4.3', '4.3', "XSS vulnerabilities occur when the Web application echoes user-supplied data in an HTML response sent to the Web browser.

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.\n<P>\n1) <B>TCP/IP Fingerprint</B>: The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this "fingerprinting" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. \n<P>\nNote that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.\n<P>\n2) <B>NetBIOS</B>: Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). \n<P>\n3) <B>PHP Info</B>: PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.\n<P>\n4) <B>SNMP</B>: The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach.

A successful exploit manipulates query criteria in a manner that affects the query\'s logic. The typical causes of this vulnerability are lack of input validation and insecure construction of the SQL query.\n</P>\n<P>Queries created by concatenating strings with SQL syntax and user-supplied data are prone to this vulnerability. When any part of the string concatenation can be modified, an attacker has the ability to change the meaning of the query.\n</P>\n<P>Typical detection techniques for SQL injection vulnerabilities use a payload that attempts to produce an error response from the web application. Detection based on blind SQL injection uses inference based on the differences among the application\'s responses to various payloads. Blind SQL does not rely on error messages, which is beneficial when testing web applications that trap errors.\n</P>\n<P><B>How It Works:</B><BR>\nThe WAS scanning engine uses a well known methodology called <I>"True and False"</I> inference to determine if there is a blind SQL injection vulnerability. Basically, it uses two payloads: one with a \n<I>"True condition"</I> and another with a <I>"False condition"</I>. If there is a blind SQL injection vulnerability, the query with the \n"True condition" payload will cause the web application to return a different response than the \n"False condition". \n</P>\nA good example of a "True condition" payload would be <B>\' AND 1=1</B>. Since 1 always equals 1, the condition is true. An example of a "False condition" payload would be <B>\' AND 1=2</B>. Since 1 does not equal 2, the condition is false.\n<P>\nFor example, let\'s say there is a web application with a textbox that searches for customer names and displays the results inside a table. And let\'s assume that if someone searches for John there is one result only. When scanning for the blind SQL injection vulnerability, the WAS scanning engine uses two payloads:</P>\n- <U>True condition payload</U>: This injects the string <B>John\' AND 1=1</B> to issue the query\n\t<I>"return John only if 1=1"</I>. Since 1 always equals 1 the condition is true. The result is John, which is the same result as using the string John.\n<P>\n- <U>False condition payload</U>: This injects the string <B>John\' AND 1=2</B> to issue the query\n\t<I>"return John only if 1=2"</I>. Since 1 is never equal to 2, the condition is false. The result is nothing or "No results found".\n<P>\nWith the results from the two payloads, the WAS scanning engine draws the conclusion that there is a blind SQL injection vulnerability. Even though there is no one called \n<I>"John\' AND 1=1"</I> in the database, web application displays information for "John" if a search is done with that query string.</P>\n<P>\n<B>Example:</B><BR>\nThese few lines demonstrate an insecure query that is created by appending user-supplied data (<B>name</B>):\n</P>\n<CODE>\nOn Error Resume Next \' Page traps error and do not display it<BR>\nSet oRSu = oCONv.Execute("SELECT fname, name FROM customers WHERE name = \'" &amp; Request("txtSearch") &amp; "\'")<BR>\nIf oRSu.BOF Or Err.Number <> 0 Then<BR>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Response.Write "No results found!"<BR>\nEnd If\n</CODE>\n<P>\nIf no checks are performed against the name parameter, then the query may be arbitrarily modified and sent to database as shown in these two examples of a completed query:\n</P>\n<CODE>\nSELECT fname, name FROM customers WHERE name=\'<B>John\' AND 1=1</B> <BR>\nSELECT fname, name FROM customers WHERE name= \'John\'; SHUTDOWN WITH NOWAIT\n</CODE>\n<P>In the first case the database will return <I>"John"</I> since the condition <B>AND 1=1</B> is always true.', 'The scope of a SQL injection exploit varies greatly. If any SQL statement can be injected into the query, then the attacker has the equivalent access of a database administrator. This access could lead to theft of data, malicious corruption of data, or deletion of data.', 'SQL injection vulnerabilities can be addressed in three areas: input validation, query creation, and database security.\n<P>\nAll input received from the web client should be validated for correct content. If a value\'s type or content range is known beforehand, then stricter filters should be applied. For example, an email address should be in a specific format and only contain characters that make it a valid address; or numeric fields like a USA zip code should be limited to five digit values.\n<P>\nPrepared statements (sometimes referred to as parameterized statements) provide strong protection from SQL injection. Prepared statements are precompiled SQL queries whose parameters can be modified when the query is executed. Prepared statements enforce the logic of the query and will fail if the query cannot be compiled correctly. Programming languages that support prepared statements provide specific functions for creating queries. These functions are more secure than string concatenation for assigning user-supplied data to a query.\n<P>\nStored procedures are precompiled queries that reside in the database. Like prepared statements, they also enforce separation of query data and logic. SQL statements that call stored procedures should not be created via string concatenation, otherwise their security benefits are negated.\n<P>\nSQL injection exploits can be mitigated by the use of Access Control Lists or role-based access within the database. For example, a read-only account would prevent an attacker from modifying data, but would not prevent the user from viewing unauthorized data. Table and row-based access controls potentially minimize the scope of a compromise, but they do not prevent exploits.\n<P>\nExample of a secure query created with a prepared statement:\n<BR>\n<CODE>\nPreparedStatement ps = "SELECT name,email FROM users WHERE userid=?";\nps.setInt(1, userid);\n</CODE>'], ['QID', '150013', 'Browser-Specific Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities', 'Confirmed Vulnerability', '5', 'XSS', 'A7', 'WASC-8', 'CWE-79', '4.3', '4.3', "XSS vulnerabilities occur when the Web application echoes user-supplied data in an HTML response sent to the Web browser.
